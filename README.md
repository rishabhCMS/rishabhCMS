### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[website](https://rishabhcms.github.io/)

#### My Name is Rishabh, I am a Ph.D. candidate at The Catholic University of America. My research work is related to the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. I was introduced to the field of Data Science and Machine Learning by a friend a few years back and ever since I have been learning by taking courses related to DS.

**I am currently working on the following projects**

  1. Ph.D. Physics analysis: I am working with the Dark Matter group at the Fermilab, the analysis is mainly focussed on Dark Matter search in a Mono-top process
  
  2. Anomaly detection at the CMS experiment at the LHC
  
  3. Azure Machine Learning on Udacity
  
**I am currently looking for volunteering opportunities to get some hands-on experience in Data Science**

**I have firm foundation in major DS skills**
  1. Python, R
  2. Data ETL
  3. Machine Learning ( Supervised, Semi-Supervised, and Clustering techniques)
  4. ML libraries : Sci-kit Learn, keras, TF
 
 **Projects**
 
**1. SQL** [Studying deforestation](https://github.com/rishabhCMS/SQL_Deforestation_project#sql-deforestation-project)

**2. DNN** [Visual Recognition](https://github.com/rishabhCMS/unbalanced_CNN)

**3. NLP** [Disaster Response using NLP](https://github.com/rishabhCMS/Disaster_Response)

 
 **awards and recognitions**
  1. FermiLab Guest and Visitors Research Fellowship
  2. First Place: Data Science Hackathon: DC voter turnout
  
  **Hobbies**
  biking, cricket,volleyball, stock market trading
